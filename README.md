## Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases samples of code I have worked on throughout my software engineering career.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: React JS and Daisy UI
- Backend: JSON Server

### How to Set Up the Project

#### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git](https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git)
   cd portfolio
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
#### Running the Project

1. To run the backend (JSON): 
    ```bash
    npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
    ```
     This will start the mock server on http://localhost:3001.

2. To run the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    This will start the React application on http://localhost:3000.

#### Viewing the Portfolio
Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the portfolio.
